**Design Patterns**
There are various design patterns in the software engineering. They are well-thought out and essential solutions to programming problems. Many software developers have encountered these problems before, and have used these 'solutions' to remedy them. Similarly, I am one of them. I always imagine that there is a world of magic design patterns in the software engineering system. Each of the design patterns have its own "living space". Besides, each one of them has its own functionality and special characteristic. They work in their little space and together form the world of magic design. 

**Experience**
When I built our group web pages, which is study club. I established the different "decorations" that we will need. For example, when people visit our website. The front page will shows the main description of study club. When people click the button, it will automatically transfer to the login page. I used the creational design patterns to help me effectively solve my problems. When the initialized instances need to be copied or cloned, I used the prototype. Also, when there is only a single instance is allow to exist, I used the singleton. Those design patterns make the work easier and efficiently get the work done.

**Conclusion**
There are many more design patterns need to study. I have only used some of them in my programming. It is important to make sure that we are trying to solve the correct problem when we are using the design patterns. In conclusion, the design patterns would become indispensable in our programming life. Moreover, it can help us to speed up our program and achieve a better result!
