JavaScript is language that evolved because of the Internet. As the Internet grew, more and more people found it a more viable place to do business. As a newbie to Javascript, I think the most important task is to start immersing yourself to learn and understand how it works in programming. After I complete the practice of simple Javascript code using FreeCodeCamp, I barely have a understanding of what Javascript is.

Javascript is slightly different from the progamming language that I learned before, which is Java. When I was doing the practice, I found out that Java is a programming language but Javascript is a scripting language. I think Javascript is a good programming language from a software engineering perspective. But the thing that bothers me about Javascript is the language syntax and semantics. Together they provide an ugly and verbose language that's generally painful to read.

In class, we have practice using the WODs. I think this is useful for us as a newbie, because it can help us to keep practicing. From the practice, I could understand how logic works. When I start to understand all of these core programming principles. I know they really apply to all programming languages. This means no matter what language I want to learn, I’ll already have a solid framework for learning it easily—by understanding those big picture programming theories.
