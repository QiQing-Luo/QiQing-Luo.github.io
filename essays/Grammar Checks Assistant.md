I agree with the statement "Coding standards can actually help people to learn a programming language." The coding standard tells us how we must write our code. Instead of each of our coding in our own preferred style, we would write all code to the standards outlined. This makes sure that our program is coded in a consistent style. Not only does this solution make the code easier to understand, but it also ensures that any of us who looks at the code will know what to expect throughout the entire program.

After my first week of using ESLint with the IntelliJ, I become more familiar with the ESLint. IntelliJ shows warnings and errors reported by ESLint right in the editor, as I type. Every time when I am finished writing a line of code, it automatically checks for me if I have any errors. I quite enjoy using ESLint with the IntelliJ, it points out what errors I have or what I should do to code correctly. The green checkmark is somehow useful but also painful. Sometimes, it is not easy to get that "green checkmark" show upon on my screen. But during the process of getting that green checkmark really helps to guide me read through all my codes, to help me correct all my little errors. Such as, missing a curly brace, wrong syntax, never use my variables, and forgot to start a new line at the end and so on. It is useful most of the times, especially when I was confused which part I was getting wrong. 

ESLint really helps me to format my code and make it easier to read. Especially for me as a newbie to learning a new programming language. My code becomes better formatted and errors are getting less since I started using ESLint. Besides, my code becomes organized and easier for other people to read.
