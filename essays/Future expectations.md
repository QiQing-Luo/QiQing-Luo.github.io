Software engineering is new to me. Before the class starts, I have no idea of what the class is going to be. I was nervous and have great pressure on taking this class. My motivation for this class is to understand every module and be able to solve every prolem. In order to become an effective engineer and to have a successful career, there are many qualities and skills an individual needs. 

In the future, I expect to have the necessary technical skills. While this class will provide the foundation of this knowledge, as technology is constantly advancing I will be expected continue to learn throughout this semester. 

Moreover, I expect to have more teamwork instead of focusing on individual work. I think work in a team environment will allow me to gain experience of team working. Students in class can share ideas and thoughts, help each other in class. 

In conclusion, engineering is dynamic so it needs people who can work across disciplines and others. It continually adapt to new challenges. More than that, software engineering includes lots of different fields. To design and build software operating systems, games and network control, would interests me the most.
