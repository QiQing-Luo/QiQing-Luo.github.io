Within these several years, I have gained diverse perspectives and knowledge from different career fields. One of my job was as a sales promoter throughout the whole store. I gained many skills of communication and problem solving by helping and greeting the many customers who came into the store. Mostly, my duties are to introduce the product to the customers and explain to them when they have any questions. The staffs I worked with were friendly and nice, we worked in a peace environment. Sometimes, we helped each other and we shared lots of stories. This was one of my good work experience.
